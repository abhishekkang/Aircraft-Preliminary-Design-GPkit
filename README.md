🎓 Submitted to: BITS Pilani, Goa Campus

📌 Overview
This project implements a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) framework using GPkit and Python, to design and compare two aircraft wing configurations:

A Blown Wing (BW) using Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)

A Conventional Wing (CW)

The tool enables early-stage sizing and performance analysis of a battery-electric Light Aircraft (LA) within a 750 kg MTOW constraint.

🧰 Project Structure
File / Module	Description
wing_struct.py, beam.py, tail.py	Defines the wing planform, loading, and structural components. Adapted from the GPkit GPlibrary.(https://github.com/convexengineering/gplibrary)
wing.py, mission.py	Defines aerodynamic models and mission segments, adapted from MIT 16.82 STOL GPkit models.(https://github.com/convexengineering/1682stol)
aircraft_gui.py	PyQt5-based GUI for input handling and output visualization.
mission.py	(Assumed) Contains definitions of mission architecture including takeoff, climb, cruise, and landing.

🔍 Key Features
Built using GPkit – a geometric programming tool for globally optimal sizing.

Modular and extensible design with support for:

Planform and structural design of wings and tail

Aerodynamic modeling of fuselage and tail boom

Battery and propulsion system sizing

User-friendly GUI built with PyQt5 for:

Selecting wing configuration (BW/CW)

Inputting key aircraft parameters (AR, span, CLmax, battery mass, etc.)

Displaying mission summary and structural plots

🖥️ How to Run
✅ Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:

Python 3.x

gpkit and gpkitmodels (for geometric programming and material data)

PyQt5

NumPy, Matplotlib

💻 To Run the GUI

# From the project root directory
python aircraft_gui.py
✨ Outputs Provided
✅ Optimized aircraft design variables (mass, range, wing dimensions)

📊 Wing Structural Plots:

Bending Moment

Tip Deflection

Distributed Load

Spar Inertia

Section Modulus

✈️ Mission Performance Summary:

Cruise / Stall Speed

Estimated Range

Battery Capacity

Mass Breakdown

📈 Results Summary (from Thesis)
Blown Wing (BW):

Enables shorter takeoff distances

Provides enhanced lift via DEP during STOL

Results in higher battery consumption and shorter range

Conventional Wing (CW):

Superior cruise efficiency

Offers longer operational range

✅ Both configurations meet structural safety criteria as validated via FEM simulations.
